            Personal statement
        </h1>
        <p>
            The first time that I entered a lab I was amazed; in fact everything about it caught my imagination.
I´ve always considered science and mathematics as my main interest. I´m very determined, precise, analytic, and believe I am a very good at problem solving. I have achieved this through my hard work. I´m the type to go a step forward in what I do, researching about the subject I´m doing and adding some extra personal work to it, in fact I bought myself a pc the which I assembled myself, so I have a very good knowledge in computers cable management, CPU and GPU, all this was to help my learning. I enjoy finding new ways to do things or just improving on things that I already know.
I have some work experience, working as a secretary at a public building during a year where I learnt skills such as working under pressure, and good communication because I had to complete several deadlines in a small period of time and went through various presentations at my school concerning my work. I have a lot of awards including several medals and trophies from karate competitions; medals from handball tournaments. I was selected with other 2 pupils to represent my school in a mathematics competition by getting the highest score in the test mock exam. I was giving 4/5 achieving awards in my first year at school in Scotland. Also, as I mentioned before, I'm very good with computers, being able to do some advanced programing from scratch; I have also built my own PC and can fix most technical issues with a computer or virus.
I´ve been studying in Spain for the past years until I came to Scotland to study in October of 2020, I didn´t come in time so I couldn´t take any Higher in S5, so in my final year I'm studying 5 Higher, including the 3 sciences.
I´m fluent in Spanish and English is my first language.
I would basically describe myself as a determined person, who sets a target or goal and won't stop trying until I achieve it. I have developed other skills with my sports training; for example, I developed good self-discipline because I have practiced karate for several years and I am a green belt. I have very good teamwork skills and learned a lot from playing handball and basketball. I´m always very committed to supporting anyone who needs or wants my guidance.
As I said before, I´m not the type to keep my knowledge to myself as a matter of fact I enjoy helping my fellow classmates with their work, problems and issues not only including school, till the point where I would purpose going on a study group during at the hour at the library, I believe it that it doesn´t alone help them to polish their skills and help them achieve mature as a person, but also give me the opportunity to improve myself by teaching others and doing my own research as well. As a result of this I could satisfy the people around me and gains skills like patience and empathy.
Moreover, by the end of this school curse I hope to achieve the Caritas award, the which you receive by serving your community during 40 volunteering hours, as well as think about the Christian religion and the impact of this in our life.
The reason why I think I would be suitable to study engineering at your university is due to all the skills that I´ve mentioned before but If one of them had to highlight, that´s my creativity, my wish to discover, create and improve things around me it´s my biggest blessing.
I´m looking forward to giving the biggest step yet in my life when I study engineering at your university. I am confident I can be successful and mark a difference during my career journey in your university.
